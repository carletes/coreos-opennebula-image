# CoreOS image for OpenNebula

This repository contains a [Packer](https://www.packer.io) template
for creating [CoreOS](https://coreos.com) KVM images for
[OpenNebula](http://opennebula.org).

Based on [@bfraser](https://github.com/bfraser)'s
[packer-coreos-qemu](https://github.com/bfraser/packer-coreos-qemu).


## Building the OpenNebula image

You will need:

* [Packer](https://www.packer.io) (tested with version 0.10.0)
* [QEMU](http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) (tested with version 2.0.0)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

A Linux host with KVM support will make the build much faster.

The build process is driven with `make`:

    $ make
	[..]
	Image file builds/coreos-alpha-991.0.0-qemu/packer-qemu ready
	$

By default, `make` will build a CoreOS image from the
[CoreOS alpha channel](https://coreos.com/releases/). You may specify
a particular CoreOS version and channel by passing the appropriate
parameters to `make`:

    $ make COREOS_CHANNEL=stable COREOS_VERSION=899.13.0 COREOS_MD5_CHECKSUM=31f1756ecdf5bca92a8bff355417598f
	[..]
	Image file builds/coreos-stable-899.13.0-qemu/packer-qemu ready
	$

You may enable compression to generate a compressed bz2 image by passing
the appropriate parameters to `make`:

    $ make PACKER_IMAGE_COMPRESSION=true
    [..]
    bzip2 -9vk builds/coreos-alpha-991.0.0-qemu/packer-qemu
    [..]
    Image file builds/coreos-alpha-991.0.0-qemu/packer-qemu ready
    $

## Registering the image with OpenNebula

Once the image has been built, you may upload it to OpenNebula using
the
[Sunstone UI](http://docs.opennebula.org/4.14/user/virtual_resource_management/img_guide.html#id1).

Alternatively, if you are allowed to access OpenNebula using its
[command-line tools](http://docs.opennebula.org/4.14/user/references/cli.html#id1),
you may upload the image usng `make`:

    $ make register

The `register` target also accepts specific CoreOS channels and
versions:

    $ make register COREOS_CHANNEL=stable COREOS_VERSION=899.13.0 COREOS_MD5_CHECKSUM=31f1756ecdf5bca92a8bff355417598f

If you plan on using OpenNebula's
[EC2 interface](http://docs.opennebula.org/4.14/advanced_administration/public_cloud/ec2qcg.html),
the image should be tagged with the attribute `EC2_AMI` set to `YES`
(the `register` target does this for you).


## Creating an OpenNebula VM template

Before creating CoreOS VMs, you will need to create an
[OpenNebula VM template](http://docs.opennebula.org/4.14/user/virtual_resource_management/vm_guide.html#creating-virtual-machines)
which uses the CoreOS images you have built. The VM template should
follow these conventions:

* It should use the image you have created and uploaded.
* The first network interface will be used as CoreOS' private IPv4
  address.
* If there is a second network interface defined, it will be used as
  CoreOS' public IPv4 network.
* You should add a user input field called `USER_DATA`, so that you
  may pass extra
  [cloud-config](https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/cloud-config.html)
  user data to configure your CoreOS instance.

The following template assumes a CoreOS image called `coreos-alpha`,
and two virtual networks called `public-net` and `private-net`, and
uses them to provide the disk and the two network interfaces of a
virtual machine:

	NAME = coreos-alpha
	MEMORY = 512
	CPU = 1
	HYPERVISOR = kvm
	OS = [
	  ARCH = x86_64,
	  BOOT = hd
	]
	DISK = [
	  DRIVER = qcow2,
	  IMAGE = coreos-alpha
	]
	NIC=[
	  NETWORK = private-net
	]
	NIC=[
	  NETWORK = public-net
	]
	GRAPHICS = [
	  TYPE = VNC,
	  LISTEN = 0.0.0.0
	]
	USER_INPUTS = [
	  USER_DATA = "M|text|User data for `cloud-config`"
	]
	CONTEXT = [
	  NETWORK = YES,
	  SET_HOSTNAME = "$NAME",
	  SSH_PUBLIC_KEY = "$USER[SSH_PUBLIC_KEY]",
	  USER_DATA = "$USER_DATA"
	]


### Templates for the OpenNebula EC2 interface

If you plan on using OpenNebula's
[EC2 interface](http://docs.opennebula.org/4.14/advanced_administration/public_cloud/ec2qcg.html),
your template should follow instead these conventions:

* It must **not** use any image, since the disk will be provided by
  the AMI you choose when you create your instances.
* It must include the attribute `EC2_INSTANCE_TYPE` set to a valid AWS
  instance type. If you plan on using OpenNebula's `econe-*`
  command-line tools, ensure that name is recognised by the Ruby AWS
  modules they depend on.
* The first network interface will be used as CoreOS' private IPv4
  address.
* If there is a second network interface defined, it will be used as
  CoreOS' public IPv4 network.

The following template assumes you have two virtual networks called
`public-net` and `private-net`, and uses them to provide the two
network interfaces of a virtual machine:

	NAME = t1.micro
	EC2_INSTANCE_TYPE = t1.micro
	MEMORY = 512
	CPU = 1
	HYPERVISOR = kvm
	OS = [
	  ARCH = x86_64,
	  BOOT = hd
	]
	NIC=[
	  NETWORK = private-net
	]
	NIC=[
	  NETWORK = public-net
	]
	GRAPHICS = [
	  TYPE = VNC,
	  LISTEN = 0.0.0.0
	]
	CONTEXT = [
	  NETWORK = YES,
	  SET_HOSTNAME = "$NAME",
	  SSH_PUBLIC_KEY = "$USER[SSH_PUBLIC_KEY]"
	]


### Setting the VM host name

In both examples above, the host name in the VM will be set to the
OpenNebula VM name. If you want the host name to be assigned by
reverse DNS lookup, replace the line:

    SET_HOSTNAME = "SNAME"

with:

    DNS_HOSTNAME = YES

in the `CONTEXT` section, as you would do with any other OpenNebula
template.

If no host name is passed (or none can be found with reverse DNS
lookup), the VM host name will be set to a value based on the MAC
address of the first network interface.

If you specify a value for the `hostname` field in the `cloud-config`
user data, it will take precedence over anything else.
